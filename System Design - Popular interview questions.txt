Ques-1 -> (SCALER QUESTION 31552 074d) - 

    In a distributed system with two different machines that need to generate unique IDs for incoming writes, can auto-incremented IDs (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...) be trusted for this task?

# Solution - No, auto-incremented IDs might conflict (both machines can generate the same ID)

Ques-2 -> (SCALER QUESTION 31554 a5f6) - 

    How does the Twitter Snowflakes Algorithm ensure unique and incremental 64-bit IDs by incorporating various components?

# Solution - By incorporating data center and machine IDs, along with timestamps and a sequence ID

Ques-3 -> (SCALER QUESTION 31553 3ad2) - 

    In a distributed system with two different machines responsible for generating unique IDs for incoming writes, can timestamps be relied upon to generate these IDs?

# Solution - No, timestamps may result in collisions when used on different machines
