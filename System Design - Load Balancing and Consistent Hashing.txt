    In a consistent hashing setup, servers A, B, C, and D are assigned points on a hash ring:
    Server A: 0x275D8A1F (Decimal: 660441631)
    Server B: 0xABE4C723 (Decimal: 2883897123)
    Server C: 0x601F392A (Decimal: 1612658986)
    Server D: 0xFF8B19D6 (Decimal: 4287306198)
    A request with the hash 0x8F74B2E1 (Decimal: 2406789857) needs to be routed. Which server will handle this request?

# Solution - Server B


Ques-4 -> (SCALER QUESTION 30681 059f) - 

    In a distributed system, a consistent hashing algorithm is used for load balancing among servers A, B, C, and D, each represented by their unique hash values on the ring:
    Server A: 0x12AB34CD (Decimal: 313210061)
    Server B: 0x23BC45DE (Decimal: 599541214)
    Server C: 0x34CD56EF (Decimal: 885872367)
    Server D: 0x56EF1234 (Decimal: 1458508340)
    A new server, Server E, with the hash value 0x45DE67F0 (Decimal: 1172203504), is added to the system. After adding Server E, which server(s) will be responsible for handling the data that was previously assigned to Server D?

# Solution - Server D and Server E
